class Part(SkidlBaseObject):
    """
    A class for storing a definition of a schematic part.

    Attributes:
        ref: String storing the reference of a part within a schematic (e.g., 'R5').
        value: String storing the part value (e.g., '3K3').
        footprint: String storing the PCB footprint associated with a part (e.g., SOIC-8).
        pins: List of Pin objects for this part.

    Args:
        lib: Either a SchLib object or a schematic part library file name.
        name: A string with name of the part to find in the library, or to assign to
            the part defined by the part definition.
        dest: String that indicates where the part is destined for (e.g., LIBRARY).
        tool: The format for the library file or part definition (e.g., KICAD).
        connections: A dictionary with part pin names/numbers as keys and the
            names of nets to which they will be connected as values. For example:
            { 'IN-':'a_in', 'IN+':'GND', '1':'AMPED_OUTPUT', '14':'VCC', '7':'GND' }
        part_defn: A list of strings that define the part (usually read from a
            schematic library file).
        circuit: The Circuit object this Part belongs to.

    Keyword Args:
        attribs: Name/value pairs for setting attributes for the part.
            For example, manf_num='LM4808MP-8' would create an attribute
            named 'manf_num' for the part and assign it the value 'LM4808MP-8'.

    Raises:
        * Exception if the part library and definition are both missing.
        * Exception if an unknown file format is requested.
