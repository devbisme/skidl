After three years since version 1.0, today marks the release of SKiDL version **2.0.0**.
The increment in the major version number indicates that this release is not backward compatible
with previous versions, so some SKiDL code may not work if:

1. It relies on Python 2 (which is is no longer supported).
2. It uses the @package decorator (which was dropped).

If either of these things are important to you, then stick with version 1.2.3.

Here's a list of other changes in 2.0.0:

- Additional `Part` attributes can be specified when exporting libraries.
- A `unexpio` dict has been to `Interface` objects for accessing I/O without buses expanded into individual nets.
- `connect()` and `__iadd__()` methods were added to allow interconnection of `Interface` objects. 
- Part libraries are pickled when first loaded for faster access on subsequent accesses.
  The directory for storing the pickled library files is specified in the SKiDL configuration file.
- The `KICAD` tool identifier now points to `KICAD8`.

made in each release.
