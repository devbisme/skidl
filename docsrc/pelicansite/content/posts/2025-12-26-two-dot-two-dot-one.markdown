Today marks the release of SKiDL version **2.2.1**.
This release fixes a few bugs to get ready for the new year.

Here are the changes in 2.2.1:

- Pin aliases are now updated after pin deletion, renaming, renumbering, and swapping.
- Footprint search paths for each version of KiCad are now lists of paths rather than a single path.
- File-like objects (like StringIO) are now accepted for things like netlist generation outputs. 

See [SKiDL's complete history](https://github.com/devbisme/skidl/blob/master/HISTORY.md) for all the changes
made in each release.
