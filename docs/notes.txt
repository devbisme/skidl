Setup:

  1. Place .nojekyll file at the root of the repository.
  2. Place an index.html into the root directory with redirect code to the docs/_site.
  3. Github pages can be from master or docs folder. Doesn't seem to matter.
  4. _config.yml url should be set to url: https://xesscorp.github.io/<repo name>/docs/_site.
     (No need to change url for local server during development.)

Adding a new post:

  1. octopress new post "name of post".
  2. Edit _posts/name-of-post.
  3. Run "jekyll serve",
  4. View it at http://127.0.0.1:4000.

To rebuild website:

  1. Go into docs/_api and run "make singlehtml".
  2. Return to docs.
  4. Run "jekyll build".
  5. Run "git add ." to add any newly-created files.
  6. Run 'git commit -a -m "Website updated."'.
  7. Run 'git push origin master'.
