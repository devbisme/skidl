Thanks for showing interest in SKiDL, a small package that let's you design electronic
circuits using Python.


### Inspiration

SKiDL was inspired by two other projects:

* [PHDL](http://sourceforge.net/p/phdl/wiki/Home/) is a schematic design 
  language that exemplifies the main features I wanted in SKiDL: 
  concise, text-based design entry with support for hierarchy.
* [MyHDL](http://myhdl.org/) showed how to use the features of Python to support a particular
  application (designing/simulating digital logic systems) while keeping access to a
  rich software ecosystem.


### Contributors

SKiDL was created by [Dave Vandenbout of XESS Corporation](mailto:devb@xess.com), who did the original implementation.
So far, that's it.
