This post describes using SKiDL for a USB-to-JTAG interface
that was taken all the way from concept to physically building the device.

{%img /images/usb_to_jtag/assembled_brd.png "Assembled USB-to-JTAG board" %}

The interface is pretty simple. It's built from the following stuff:

* A PIC32MX220 microcontroller.
* A 12 MHz crystal.
* Some reset circuitry.
* A six-pin Microchip programming header (for the PIC32).
* A mini-USBB connector.
* A six-pin header for connecting to a JTAG port.
* A 5V-to-3.3V voltage regulator.
* A status LED.

Here's a block diagram to help orient you as the SKiDL code is presented.

{% img /images/usb_to_jtag/block_diag.png 400 "USB-to-JTAG device block diagram" %}

Any SKiDL project starts as a Python file.
In this example, I created the file `intfc_brd.py`.
The first line in the file imports all the functions and classes of the `skidl` module:

``` py
from skidl import *
```

Next, I made strings that contain the paths to some of my personal KiCad symbol libraries.
If these libraries ever move to another directory, then I only have to make a change here.
(The libraries that come with KiCad are included by default by querying the `KISYSMOD` 
environment variable.)

``` py
# Libraries.
xess_lib = r'C:\xesscorp\KiCad\libraries\xess.lib'
pic32_lib = r'C:\xesscorp\KiCad\libraries\pic32.lib'
pickit3_lib = r'C:\xesscorp\KiCad\libraries\pickit3.lib'
```

Then I made templates for a resistor and a capacitor from the standard KiCad `device` library.
I'll make copies of these later on whenever I need one of these common components
in the design.
As with the libraries, if I ever need to modify these components (to use a 
different footprint, for instance) then I only need to make the change here to
have it take effect globally.

``` py
# Some common parts used as templates.
res = Part('device', 'R', footprint='Resistors_SMD:R_0603', dest=TEMPLATE)
cap = Part('device', 'C', footprint='Capacitors_SMD:C_0603', dest=TEMPLATE)
```

I start the actual circuit design by defining three nets that distribute power
to all the other parts: ground, 5V from the USB port, and 3.3V generated by the
voltage regulator.
I also set the `drive` attribute of the ground and 5V nets to indicate they are
for distributing power.
(I didn't need to do that for the 3.3V net because that will happen automatically
when it is connected to the output of the regulator.)

``` py
# Global nets.
gnd = Net('GND')
gnd.drive = POWER
vusb = Net('VUSB')
vusb.drive = POWER
vdd = Net('+3.3V')
```

Next, I instantiated a voltage regulator from my personal library: a Texas Instruments TPS79333.
I also assigned an SOT-23-5 package to it from the `TO_SOT_Packages_SMD` footprint
library distributed with KiCad.
Since I only needed one of these regulators, I omitted the `dest=TEMPLATE` argument and
instantiated it directly into the circuit instead of making it a template.

``` py
# Regulate +5V VUSB down to +3.3V for VDD.
vreg = Part(xess_lib, 'TPS793XX', footprint='TO_SOT_Packages_SMD:SOT-23-5')
```

The input power to the regulator arrives on the 5V net from the USB port.
The enable pin is also pulled high with the 5V net in order to enable the regulator.
This can all be done with the following, single statement.
(Note that I used names instead of numbers to reference the regulator pins.
This makes the design intent clearer and decouples it from the pin numbering scheme
of a particular package.) 

``` py
vreg['IN, EN'] += vusb
```

The next two lines connect the ground pin of the regulator to the ground net,
and the regulator output to the 3.3V net:

``` py
vreg['GND'] += gnd
vreg['OUT'] += vdd
```

The TPS79333 regulator also has a *noise reduction* pin where a small capacitor
is attached to filter out hash on the regulated output.
The `cap` template I created earlier is instantiated as `noise_cap` with an assigned value of 0.01 &mu;F.
Then, the pins of `noise_cap` are attached to the noise reduction pin of the voltage
regulator and ground, respectively.

``` py
noise_cap = cap(value='0.01uf')
noise_cap[1, 2] += vreg['NR'], gnd
```

Next up is the microcontroller: a PIC32MX220 in a 28-pin SSOP package.
The part is found in my personal PIC32 library, and the SSOP package is
in a KiCad footprint library.
(The rather cryptic name for the PIC32 results from my naming the library part
`PIC32MX2*0F***B` in order to cover all the Microchip PIC32MX 200-series variants
with their differing memory sizes. Then I had to escape the `*` characters
with backslashes to stop them from being interpreted as wildcards.) 

``` py
# Microcontroller.
pic32 = Part(pic32_lib, 'pic32MX2\*0F\*\*\*B-SSOP28-SOIC28-SPDIP28',
             footprint='Housings_SSOP:SSOP-28_5.3x10.2mm_Pitch0.65mm')
```

All the power and ground pins of the microcontroller are connected with the next
three statements. *Any* microcontroller pin with `VSS` within its name gets
connected to ground, and *any* pins containing `VDD` are connected to +3.3V
(this includes the analog power and ground pins, `AVSS` and `AVDD`).
The same applies to the `VUSB3V3` pin, but here's only one of those so it really
doesn't matter.

``` py
pic32['VSS'] += gnd
pic32['VDD'] += vdd  # Main CPU power.
pic32['VUSB3V3'] += vdd  # Power to USB transceiver.
```

The next statement connects the 5V pin from the USB port to the USB voltage monitoring
pin of the microcontroller.
I had to be careful with the name of the pin because there was *another* pin
on the chip that contained `VBUS` in its name.
I prevented that pin from being selected by surrounding `VBUS` with the *start* (`^`)
and *end* (`$`) special characters for regular expressions so the pin name had to
exactly match `VBUS`.

``` py
pic32['^VBUS$'] += vusb  # Monitor power pin of USB connector.
```

The microcontroller needs some power supply bypass capacitors, so three 0.1 &mu;F
capacitors are created (as a Python list) with two attached between the 3.3V supply rail and ground
while the remaining capacitor connects to the `VCAP` pin to filter the internal CPU logic supply.

``` py
# Bypass capacitors for microcontroller.
bypass = cap(3, value='0.1uf')
bypass[0][1, 2] += vdd, gnd
bypass[1][1, 2] += vdd, gnd
bypass[2][1, 2] += pic32['VCAP'], gnd
```

The microcontroller reset circuit contains two resistors and a capacitor that
create an RC time delay on the `MCLR` pin of the PIC32.
The `r_pullup` and `filter_cap` components are connected in series between
3.3V and ground to create a delayed release from reset upon power-up, and the `r_series` resistor carries
the delayed signal to the `MCLR` pin.

``` py
# Microcontroller MCLR circuitry:
#   Pull-up resistor to VDD.
#   Filter capacitor to delay exit of reset or eliminate glitches.
#   Series resistor to isolate capacitor from device programmer.
r_pullup = res(value='10K')
filter_cap = cap(value='0.1uf')
r_pullup[2] += vdd
filter_cap[1, 2] += r_pullup[1], gnd
r_series = res(value='1K')
r_series[1, 2] += r_pullup[1], pic32['MCLR']
```

The next two lines instantiate a mini-B USB connector and attach the `D+` and `D-`
data lines to the associated pins of the microcontroller.
The USB power and ground pins are wired to the 5V and ground nets of the board.
The USB connector also has an unused pin (`NC`) which is connected to a special
*no-connect* net designated by `NC` (which prevents a warning when the ERC is run).

``` py
# USB connector.
usb_conn = Part(xess_lib, 'USBB', footprint='XESS:UX60SC-MB-5ST')
usb_conn['D\+, D-, VCC, GND, NC'] += pic32['D\+, D-'], vusb, gnd, NC
```

The shield pins of the USB connector are attached to ground through a parallel
capacitor/resistor network.
This is supposed to provide high-frequency RF shielding while preventing DC ground-loop currents.
Or something like that. Nobody's really sure.

``` py
# Noise filtering/isolation on the USB connector shield.
shld_cap = cap(value='4.7nf')
shld_res = res(value='1M')
shld_cap[1] += usb_conn['shield']
shld_res[1] += usb_conn['shield']
gnd += shld_cap[2], shld_res[2]
```

The following statements implement
a status LED driven by pin `RB4` of the PIC32 through a current-limiting resistor.
Once again, note the use of the `A` (anode) and `K` (cathode) pin names for the LED
instead of pin numbers in order to more clearly show design intent.

``` py
# LED with current-limiting resistor driven by microcontroller pin.
led = Part('device', 'led', footprint='Diodes_SMD:D_0603')
led_curr_limit = res(value='1K')
led_curr_limit[1, 2] += pic32['RB4'], led['A']
led['K'] += gnd
```

A 12 MHz crystal in a four-pin package provides the frequency source for the microcontroller.
Two of the pins (1 and 3) attach to the oscillator pins of the PIC32 (`OSC1` and `OSC2`),
while the remaining two pins connect to ground.
Two trim capacitors connect from the non-ground pins of the crystal to ground.

``` py
# Crystal and trim capacitors.
xtal = Part(xess_lib, 'XTAL4', footprint='XESS:32x25-4')
xtal.value = '12 MHz'
xtal[2, 4] += gnd
pic32['OSC1, OSC2'] += xtal[3, 1]
trim_cap = cap(2, value='10pf')
trim_cap[0][1, 2] += xtal[1], gnd
trim_cap[1][1, 2] += xtal[3], gnd
```

A six-pin header provides the attachment point for a Microchip PICKit3 programmer
that is used to program the flash memory of the PIC32.
The PICKit3 port attaches to the `MCLR`, `PGEC` and `PGED` programming pins of the PIC32.
It also connects to the 3.3V and ground nets so the PICKit3 can power the board
during programming and debugging.

``` py
# Port for attachment of device programmer.
prg_hdr = Part(pickit3_lib, 'pickit3_hdr', footprint='Pin_Headers:Pin_Header_Straight_1x06')
prg_hdr.ref = 'PRG'
prg_hdr['MCLR'] += pic32['MCLR']
prg_hdr['PGC'] += pic32['PGEC1']
prg_hdr['PGD'] += pic32['PGED1']
prg_hdr['VDD'] += vdd
prg_hdr['GND'] += gnd
```

The microcontroller receives data packets from the USB port and translates them
into JTAG signals that are driven through another six-pin header.
The `TCK`, `TMS`, `TDI`, and `TDO` JTAG signals are attached to specific pins
of the PIC32 that connect to dedicated SPI circuitry for fast JTAG transfers.

``` py
# Port for attachment of FPGA programming pins.
port = Part('conn', 'CONN_01x06', footprint='Pin_Headers:Pin_Header_Straight_1x06')
port.ref = 'JTAG'
port[1, 2] += vusb, gnd
port[3] += pic32['SCK1'] # SCK1 output for TMS.
port[5] += pic32['RB5']  # PPS: SDI1 input for TDI.
port[4] += pic32['RB15'] # PPS: SS1 output for TMS.
port[6] += pic32['RA4']  # PPS: SDO1 output for TDO.
```

The next-to-last line of the file runs an *electrical rules check* (ERC) on the
instantiated circuitry to try and detect any problems.
Unconnected pins and conflicting drivers are the usual culprits it finds.

``` py
ERC()
```

The final line outputs the circuitry netlist into a file (`intfc_brd.net`, in this case).

``` py
generate_netlist()
```

Once the Python file is complete, the netlist is created by running the command:

``` bash
python intfc_brd.py
```

Python will execute the script and generate the following warnings:

``` text
$ python intfc_brd.py

```

The ERC warns that eight of the microcontroller pins are unconnected (because I'm not using them for anything).
That might be a problem in a production design, but I'm willing to let it slide
for this project.

When `intfc_brd.net` is taken in by KiCad's PCBNEW layout editor,
the initial component arrangement looks something like this:

{%img /images/usb_to_jtag/pcbnew-unplaced.png 800 "USB-to-JTAG board with unplaced parts" %}

After a suitable amount of fiddling (none of which has anything to do with SKiDL at this point),
we get to a final PCB layout:

{%img /images/usb_to_jtag/pcbnew-routed.png 800 "USB-to-JTAG board with unplaced parts" %}

The layout is translated into [Gerber files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_format)
that are sent for fabrication into a physical PCB.
Parts are assembled with the PCB
to arrive at the finished module shown at the beginning of this post.

Initial testing of the interface board shows the microcontroller can be loaded
with a program that successfully communicates over a USB link.
While this is a relatively small board (18 components and 20 nets), it is my
first end-to-end design using SKiDL.
I'm encouraged by the fact no problems arose, although I found facets of
SKiDL that need polishing.
But that's always going to be the case.
