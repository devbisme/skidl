At the recent [KiCon 2019](https://kicad-kicon.com/), I gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WErQYI2A36M)
about SKiDL that's a good introduction to the language and why I created it.
It's about 27 minutes in length if you can stand it.

I got a lot of great feedback after my talk.
Almost everybody mentioned that they want to generate schematics from their SKiDL code.
There were several reasons for this:

* To verify that their SKiDL code did what they expected.
* For design reviews.
* Their PCB fabricator/assembler requires a schematic.
* For guidance during bench testing.

I don't agree that a schematic is necessary for all of these, but certainly
it helps for some of them.
So I'll be investigating techniques to improve SKiDL's rudimentary
schematic output.
(I've also gotten help from a Github contributor who recently submitted some
[pull requests](https://github.com/devbisme/skidl/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aweimens)
that addressed this.)

After you watch my SKiDL video,
there's a bunch of other great KiCon talks in this
[list](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkJRycUz2CylxpiP-zMePow).
