- `@package` decorator removed.
- Additional `Part`` attributes can be specified when exporting libraries.
- Added `unexpio` dict to `Interface` objects for accessing I/O without buses expanded into individual nets.
- Added connect() and __iadd__() methods to interconnect `Interface` objects. 
- Part libraries are pickled when first loaded for faster access on subsequent accesses.
  The directory for storing the pickled library files is specified in the SKiDL configuration file.

- Added backend tool identifiers of `KICAD5`, `KICAD6`, `KICAD7`, and `KICAD8`.
- For compatibility, `KICAD` tool identifier points to `KICAD5`.


1.2.1 (2023-07-26)
______________________
- `is_url` function fixed to solve problems with `search` and loading libraries.


1.2.0 (2023-07-14)
______________________

- Added ability to generate an editable schematic from a Circuit object. (Currently only works for KiCad V5.)
- Added Group object for creating hierarchy without using function calls.
- `generate_pcb` now takes an optional list of footprint library directories.
- If not explicitly declared, `Part` objects will load the default footprint from their symbol definition.
- Added `empty_footprint_handler()` for parts without footprints that logs errors by default but can be overriden by the user.
- Symbol libraries can now be searched on remote repositories by placing the URL in the `lib_search_paths` dictionary.
  KiCad V6 symbols are found at `https://gitlab.com/kicad/libraries/kicad-symbols/-/raw/master`
  and V5 symbols are at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiCad/kicad-symbols/master/`.
- `Part` pins can now be sorted and retrieved in order using the `ordered_pins` property.


1.1.0 (2021-10-22)
______________________

- Added `generate_pcb()` function to create a PCB file directly from
  a `Circuit` object. (Currently only works for KiCad.)
- Added `PartTmplt` shortcut which creates a Part template using `dest=TEMPLATE` implicitly.

1.0.0 (2021-05-09)
______________________

- Buses can now be created without names and a name will be
  automatically assigned. Or use "name=..." to manually assign a name.
  Or just place a string in the list of arguments and that will be used.
- Footprint search can now process directories of footprints without the
  need for an `fp-lib-table` file.
- `Part` fields can now be accessed using attributes.
- Creating fields requires use of `Part.fields[key]` instead of Part.key.
- Added context manager for `Circuit` object so Parts/Nets can be joined
  using a `with...` statement.
- Adding/removing `Parts` to/from a `Circuit` can now be done using `+=` and `-=`.
- Tags can be added to `Parts` and `Circuits` for hierarchical naming.
- `Part` values can now be assigned arbitrary objects including units from either PySpice or Pint.
- Multi-function pin names can now be split into a collection of shorter aliases,
  thus reducing the need to access pins using regexes.
- Schematics can now be automatically using the KiCad symbol graphics for the parts.
- The library interface now handles the Skywater 130 SPICE libraries.

* Fixed problem where the search function was only returning parts found in the last library searched.


0.0.12 (2017-04-20)
______________________

* Use of builtin now works with Python 2 & 3.
* Started using namedtuple in some places (like net traversal) for clarity.

* When pins are connected to nets, or nets to nets, the resulting set of connected nets are all given the same name.
* Buses are not added to a Circuit object if they are already members of it. This fix caused the next problem.
* Buses weren't getting added to the Circuit object because they already contained a reference to the Circuit. Fixed by clearing ref before adding to Circuit.
* Created mini_reset() method to clear circuitry without clearing library cache so the libraries don't have to be loaded again (slow).
* search() utility now prints the names of libraries as they are searched so user sees progress.
* Fixed exceptions if part definition contained non-unicode stuff.
* Hide exceptions that occur when using the show() utility.
* More tests added for NC nets and hand-crafted parts.
* default_circuit and the NC net for the active circuit are now made accessible in all modules using __builtin__.

* Each Circuit object now has its own NC net.
* Added tests for bus movement and copying.
* Implemented bus movement between Circuit objects.
* Additional test cases were created.
* Nets and Parts can now be removed from Circuits.
* The circuit that pins and nets are in is now checked before connections are made so cross-circuit connections are not created.
* Default members were added to Pin and Part objects so they would always exist and not cause errors when missing.
* Implemented moving Parts and Nets from one circuit to another (almost).
* Nets with no attached pins are now added to a circuit.
* Re-wrote some tests to account for the presence of no-pin nets in a circuit.
* A class method was missing its 'self' argument.
* Fixed @subcircuit decorator so it won't cause an error if the function it decorates doesn't have a 'circuit' keyword argument.
* Split the unit tests across multiple files. Added setup/teardown code.
* Added capability to create multiple, independent Circuit objects to which Parts and Nets can be assigned. The default circuit is still the target if not Circuit is explicitly referenced.
