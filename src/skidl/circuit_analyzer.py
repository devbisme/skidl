- Evaluate decoupling and filtering strategy
- Check for potential voltage drop issues
- Assess protection mechanisms

3. Signal Path Analysis:
- Trace critical signal paths
- Evaluate voltage divider networks
- Check for loading effects
- Identify potential noise coupling issues

4. Component Selection Review:
- Assess component values and ratings
- Review footprint selections
- Check for standard vs specialized parts
- Evaluate thermal considerations

5. Safety and Reliability:
- Identify potential failure modes
- Review protection mechanisms
- Assess thermal management
- Check compliance with basic safety practices

6. Specific Recommendations:
- List concrete suggestions for improvements
- Highlight any critical issues that need addressing
- Suggest alternative approaches where relevant
- Provide component value optimizations if needed

7. Design Best Practices:
- Compare against industry standard practices
