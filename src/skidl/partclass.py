Part class management for SKiDL PCB design.

This module provides part class management capabilities for organizing
and categorizing electronic components in PCB designs. Part classes enable designers
to group components with similar characteristics, manufacturing requirements, or
design constraints for efficient management and rule application.

Key Features:
    - Group components with similar characteristics or requirements
    - Support multiple part classes per component for complex categorization
    - Define manufacturing and assembly priorities
    - Attach arbitrary component class attributes

Classes:
    PartClass: Represents a single part class with properties and categorization rules.
        Stores component characteristics, priorities, and custom attributes for
        grouping related electronic components.
        
    PartClassList: A specialized list container for managing multiple PartClass 
        objects. Enables components to belong to multiple classes simultaneously
        for complex categorization scenarios.

Constants:
    DEFAULT_PARTCLASS: Default priority value (0) for standard part classes.
        Lower priority values indicate lower precedence in component selection
        and rule application scenarios.

Common Use Cases:
    - Power components requiring special thermal management
    - High-frequency components needing controlled placement
    - Critical components requiring premium part selection
    - Components grouped by supplier or manufacturer
    - Assembly groups for pick-and-place optimization

Example Usage:
    >>> # Create part classes for different component types
    >>> power_parts = PartClass('PowerComponents', 
    ...                        priority=10,           # High priority
    ...                        thermal_mgmt=True,    # Requires thermal management
    ...                        placement='keep_out') # Special placement rules
    >>> 
    >>> precision_parts = PartClass('PrecisionComponents',
    ...                            priority=5,         # Medium priority
    ...                            tolerance='1%',     # Tight tolerance requirement
    ...                            supplier='premium') # Premium supplier required
    >>> 
    >>> # Create component grouping
    >>> critical_parts = PartClassList(power_parts, precision_parts)
    >>> 
    >>> # Apply to components
    >>> voltage_reg = Part('LM7805', ref='U1')
    >>> voltage_reg.partclasses = power_parts
    >>> 
    >>> precision_resistor = Part('R', ref='R1', value='10k', tolerance='1%')
    >>> precision_resistor.partclasses = precision_parts

Priority System:
    Lower numeric priority values indicate lower precedence. When components
    belong to multiple classes or when classes conflict, the class with
    the highest priority number takes precedence for rule resolution.

    """
    Defines a group of electronic components sharing common characteristics or requirements.

    Part classes provide a mechanism for organizing components with similar properties,
    manufacturing requirements, or design constraints. They enable designers to apply
    consistent rules across multiple components and facilitate bulk operations on
    component groups.

    The PartClass stores various component characteristics and custom attributes that
    can be used for component selection, placement rules, manufacturing constraints,
    and design automation. These attributes are typically used by design tools and
    scripts to automatically apply appropriate component handling and placement rules.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Unique identifier for the part class within the circuit.
            Used for referencing and organizing part classes.
        priority (int): Precedence level for rule conflicts (default: 0).
            Lower values indicate lower priority when resolving conflicts.
        circuit (Circuit): Reference to the circuit containing this part class.

    Additional attributes can be added via keyword arguments during initialization
    to store custom properties specific to the component group, such as:
        - Manufacturing requirements (e.g., lead_free=True)
        - Thermal properties (e.g., max_temp=125)
        - Placement constraints (e.g., keep_out_zones=['bottom'])
        - Supplier information (e.g., preferred_supplier='Digikey')
        - Assembly requirements (e.g., pick_and_place=True)

    Design Rule Examples:
        - Power components: Special thermal management, larger keep-out zones
        - High-frequency components: Controlled placement, special routing
        - Critical components: Premium part selection, redundancy requirements
        - Standard components: Standard handling, cost optimization

    where components may need to satisfy multiple sets of design rules or
    categorization schemes.

    It also supports recursive addition from other PartClassList objects and
    priority-based sorting for rule precedence.

    Features:
        - Automatic deduplication of part class objects
        - Support for adding part classes by name (with circuit lookup)

        Get a list of part class names sorted by their priority values.

        Returns the names of all part classes in the list, sorted in ascending
        order by their priority values. This is useful for applying design rules
        in the correct precedence order, where higher priority numbers indicate
        higher precedence.

        Returns:
            list[str]: A list of part class names sorted by priority (lowest first).
                Empty list if no part classes are present.

        Examples:
            >>> critical = PartClass('Critical', priority=10)
            >>> important = PartClass('Important', priority=5)
            >>> standard = PartClass('Standard', priority=1)
