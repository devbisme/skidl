            1. Bus.__getitem__ is called with '7:0' as the index. This
               returns a NetPinList of eight nets from my_bus.

               method makes the actual connection to the part pin or pins. Then
               it creates an iadd_flag attribute in the object it returns.
            3. Finally, Bus.__setitem__ is called. If the iadd_flag attribute
               is true in the passed argument, then __setitem__ was entered
